summary = "We use different programming languages and development environments to write apps. Each language comes with a different flow and also we typically go through different phases, from prototyping to integration-level activities to incrementally adding features or fixing bugs once the app is in production. Now, the expectation of a developer coming from a “traditional” environment to Kubernetes is in general that their natural and well-known workflow changes as little as possible. This article reviews where we stand in Kubernetes-land concerning developing apps and where we may be heading."
