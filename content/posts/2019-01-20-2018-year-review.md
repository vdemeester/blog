Here is my review of 2018, the first of its kind, hopefully not the last ðŸ‘¼. I saw some[^fn:1]
_2018[^fn:2] reviews_[^fn:3] articles[^fn:4] in my feedly feed and I thought it would be a good idea to write my
own too.

I'll try in the next year â€” maybe month if I ever want to do monthly reviews â€” to automate
some of it ; using the beloved `org-mode`.

## <span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span> Writing {#writing}

-   2017 was a slow year in terms of writing (only 2 posts), 2018 was a bit better, 6 posts.
    But it's a bit cheating, as it was mainly between changing jobs, and on a series I still
    need to finish
