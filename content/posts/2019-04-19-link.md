summary = "Every single one of those libraries had some fundamental problems that made it unusable in any real world applications. Furthermore every single one of those libraries was written in a way which made fixing the issues impossible without altering the existing library APIs in a non backwards compatibile way. As the same problems unfortunately plague many other Go libraries I attempted to list most of the sins commited by their authors below."
