Two weeks ago, my _online_ personal server has been attacked and, somehow, died. I'm in the process
of re-installation of it but I'm going to hardened a bit the security on it. Anyway, this crash meant
that every piece of site I maintain has been down. That's why I moved this _identity site_ on the
github pages, using a CNAME ; That way I can crash as much as I want my server(s), this page should
still be up for a while.

And I'm switching on Jekyll for this website as It is supported by Github page, easy to use and easy
to deploy elsewhere (if one day I want to move from Github).

The rest of the post is going to be used as a *sandbox* post to test the site styles.
